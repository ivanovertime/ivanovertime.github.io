I am a curious and avid reader, movie goer and Japanophile who likes to keep up with the latest trends and developments in data engineering and related fields. I like to explore different cultures and perspectives, and I'm always open to new challenges.

As a junior full stack developer, I enjoy developing scalable web applications that can adapt to changing customer needs and market trends. I have hands-on experience in building composable commerce solutions, using various technologies to create customized and flexible E-commerce platforms.
