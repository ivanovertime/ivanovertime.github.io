Hi, I'm a Information Engineer from Valencia,Venezuela. 

I'm really curious and like to figure out how things work. I like movies, cooking and anything related to data. I like to explore different cultures and perspectives, especially from Japan.

I usually work as a full stack developer, and I'm used to wearing many hats. I enjoy working with data and developing scalable web applications. I have hands-on experience in building composable commerce solutions but I'm always open to new challenges.
