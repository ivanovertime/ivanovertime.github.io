# Situation
I've been wanting to use Hugo for a while and when it came time to update from Nuxt 2 to 3 I thought it would be great to give a go (get it?). Anyway, remember that Hugo and Nuxt serve different purposes. While Nuxt is great for dynamic apps, Hugo excels at creating fast, static websites so this is actually a for what it was design.

# Solution 
1. **Understanding the Basics:**
    
    - **Nuxt 2**: Nuxt is a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications. It provides server-side rendering (SSR), routing, and other features out of the box.
    - **Hugo**: Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It generates static HTML files from Markdown content and templates.
2. **Content Migration**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Content**: If your Nuxt 2 site uses the content module, you’ll need to extract your content (such as blog posts, pages, etc.) from the Nuxt content directory.
    - **Hugo Content**: Create a new Hugo project and organize your content in the `content` directory. Each content file should be in Markdown format.
3. **Templates and Layouts**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Layouts**: Nuxt uses layouts to structure your pages. In Hugo, you’ll create templates and layouts using Go’s templating language.
    - **Hugo Templates**: Learn about Hugo’s templating system and create templates for your homepage, blog posts, and other content types.
4. **Front Matter and Metadata**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Front Matter**: Extract metadata (such as title, date, tags) from your Nuxt content files.
    - **Hugo Front Matter**: Hugo uses front matter (in YAML, TOML, or JSON format) at the beginning of each content file. Define metadata there.
5. **Routing and URLs**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Routes**: Nuxt automatically generates routes based on your folder structure. In Hugo, you’ll define your routes explicitly in the `config.toml` or `config.yaml`.
    - **Hugo Permalinks**: Customize your URLs using Hugo’s permalink configuration.
6. **Plugins and Features**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Plugins**: If you’re using Nuxt plugins (e.g., for SEO, analytics), find Hugo equivalents or adapt your approach.
    - **Hugo Features**: Explore Hugo’s built-in features, such as taxonomies, shortcodes, and partials.
7. **Build and Deployment**:
    
    - **Nuxt 2 Build**: Nuxt builds your app dynamically. In Hugo, run `hugo` to generate static files.
    - **Deployment**: Deploy your Hugo site to a web server or a static hosting service.

 Good luck with your migration!
